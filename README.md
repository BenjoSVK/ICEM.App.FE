## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure environment variables in `.env`

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Building for Production

Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production with HTTPS

For production, use SSL/TLS and serve the app over HTTPS:

1. Obtain certificates (e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) and place `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` in a `certs/` directory (or mount your certificate path).
2. Run the production stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
   ```
3. See [docs/HTTPS_PRODUCTION.md](docs/HTTPS_PRODUCTION.md) for detailed setup, certificate options, and security headers.

### Deployment to live VGG server

1. Push updated code to github
2. Execute Github action to create build
    - open Actions tab in github
    - choose "Build and push Docker image for IKEM FE"
    - click "Run workflow", set docker tag to new version number
    - run workflow, wait for build to finish
